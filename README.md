## Description
react-portfolio is my portfolio! Take a look! I created this application to put my react skills to the test. And also more importantly, to re-do my portfolio. 
There will be future updates as it is not up to my standards yet as far as content and styling. Mobile responsiveness will also be coming in the future.

3. Run `git clone` command in Terminal with the pasted link
4. Run `code .` command to open in VS Code.
5. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
6. Run `npm start` to initialize the server on your local if you wish to view it there.
7. Enjoy

## Tools
The tools I used to create this application are:
